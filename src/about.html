                    <b>Like so many others, we’ve watched with deepening distress as the very technology meant to provide universal access to opportunity and bring us together has become the primary vector for extreme polarization, division, and inequity.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The two of us had spent years working separately on this issue. We come from very different perspectives—one of us is a builder of social impact networks and a business and civic entrepreneur, and the other a builder of startups and social networking software. Yet we share firsthand knowledge of the immense patience, long-range view, and gritty work it takes to build sustainable infrastructure. At an event on none other than Liberty Island, we made the commitment to build together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We focused our work with a question: Could we use technology not only to restore, but scale our capacity to build trusted relationships, that bedrock of healthy societies, economies, and democracies? From the beginning, we agreed that addressing one of the most deep-seated problems of our time would require far more than new iterations of today’s entrenched and closed models. We need a bold new model, built by a global collective of diverse, multidisciplinary thinkers and creators. We need to find a way to embed values in the core technology, the protocol itself, as a foundation for indelible protections for the people who will eventually use it. And most importantly, we need an open model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We identified the possibility for just such a model in what may seem an unexpected place: the concept at the core of the social network itself, known as the social graph. The term “social graph” isn’t widely known beyond Internet technology circles, but it is a digital representation of all the relationships between members of a social network. When we use a social network—as nearly 60 percent of the world does—all the ways we connect, learn, transact, consume and contribute traverse this essential online circuitry. Thus, the social graph holds immense power over us all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet the largest social networks are owned and controlled by powerful, private companies, and each is built upon its own proprietary social graph. In this balkanized system, corporations broker our relationships, surveil our movements and interactions, and determine what information we see, amplifying the division and polarization plaguing us today. It has become increasingly clear that these old models have failed us. And it has become increasingly clear that society can no longer afford models built on private social graphs that prioritize corporate gain over the welfare of society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A key to unlock change at scale comes from building an alternate, open source web protocol that is driven by transparency, economic inclusion, trust, and societal benefit. So in late 2019, shortly after that first commitment on Liberty Island, we assembled a team and began to build just that. Today we open the first phase of our work to the public (link to whitepaper), to be followed soon by open source code and a call for others to learn and build with us.

                <aside id="interjection"><b>Reclaiming the social graph for the public good is one of the greatest opportunities of our time.</b></aside>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    We now have the opportunity to reclaim the social graph for the public who uses it—to take ownership of our digital relationships from the private sector and make it a part of the Internet itself, as a public good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Imagine this:</b> A unified, universally accessible social graph will not be owned by any organization—it will be for all of us. It will be open and transparent, not closed and opaque like today’s social graphs. It will put people in control of their own data—what is kept private, and what is shared. It will generate economic value for people rather than extracting economic value from users. It will unlock opportunity for us all to directly benefit from the value our own network generates. It will wrest control of our data from big tech and put it where it belongs: in each of our hands. As common infrastructure, it will lower barriers for all kinds of entrepreneurs and social innovators, opening the market for new applications, business models, and algorithms, with higher standards for serving society over shareholders. This new social graph will give us the capability to drive social impact at scale—a shared, decentralized social good that serves as public infrastructure in support of economic and social health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    <b>What’s Different About Our Approach</b>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is not the first to explore the concept of a decentralized social network, but we believe our approach is distinct in the combination of these four elements:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>The protocol is built to be a public good.</b> To become a universally accessible public good, the social graph must be freed from commercial or speculative gain at the protocol level. Thus, while our approach leverages public blockchains, it does not introduce a new token required to interact with the social graph. While there could be token-based models at the application layer, we believe a protocol layer token could create friction, and even reduce equality of access over time.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>We will not rely on traditional venture capital business models.</b> The protocol itself will generate no financial returns, as it will be gifted to humanity. Traditional venture capital-driven technology models have an important place in our economy, but the focus on short-term interest is at odds with the development and broad adoption of a decentralized, unified, and universally accessible social graph. Instead, we founded Project Liberty with the condition that this core technology remains a public good—without expectation for commercial return.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course, for the protocol to be successful, entrepreneurs must want to invest in innovating and participating in a new ecosystem. Think of the protocol as a road constructed in an undeveloped area. There are no returns from the road itself, but it could catalyze access to a thriving economy built on top of that initial investment in infrastructure. We are working on building the road, but we also hope to later discover some of these business models that can fuel sustainable businesses. Because the protocol will be open source, however—the road is open to all—our team will not have any advantage over other developers.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>People are at the center of protocol design.</b> The design of the protocol is centered around people, and how they want and need to interact with other people in order to build and leverage trusted relationships. This means we are embedding guardrails into the protocol that protect users and their data, and enable authentication of users and content. We’ve seen a great deal of work that relies on the application layer to provide user protections, but too often, these efforts are compromised due to tradeoffs made to align with shareholder interests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We designed with the commitment to providing all people with complete control of the use of their data, their network of relationships, and their identity, including how they are represented on the blockchain. We believe this is a unique approach to decentralizing the social graph—made possible by our decision that the protocol itself will not be monetized or held accountable to deliver financial returns.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>Although our vision is bold, we seek to simplify our innovation.</b> By nature, a social graph is connective tissue: it ties together many of the technology features we use today—from direct messaging to forums to mapping to video serving. A unified, decentralized social graph is thus in a critical position to connect the great work of many teams that are already working on innovative point solutions, and we seek to work with leaders across the landscape. It is for this reason that, while we are taking on an ambitious mission, we can narrow our scope to innovate only where we need solutions that don’t yet exist.
                        </p>

                <h2><b>We Hope You Will Be Inspired to Join Us</b></h2>
                <p>
                    This project is about much more than building a new web protocol. It is about contributing to a broader movement of builders and creators that are coming together to take bold action in a precipitous moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The global pandemic has challenged all of us: citizens, institutions, governments, countries, in ways we never imagined. It has, like no other phenomenon in our remembered history, laid bare the vast structural vulnerabilities and inequities of our societies. We face a reckoning: Will we continue to look the other way? Or join together with hard work to create generative and sustainable structures and systems that unlock real opportunity not just for a few, but for all? We believe that building the technology to support trusted networks of relationships, at scale, is a critical step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>We cannot do this important work alone.</b> Whatever we accomplish at the protocol level, it will be unfinished without the collaborative effort of many, many more communities, developers, thought leaders, and changemakers willing to reclaim a new order for our digital lives. This is work that will never be fully finished, yet is essential to undertake. We hope you will be able to imagine a place for yourself in driving what we believe could be some of the most essential infrastructure work of our time, guided by the better angels of our human nature.
